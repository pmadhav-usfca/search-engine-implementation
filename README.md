# Search-Engine-Implementation

Implemented three different searching mechanisms to efficiently search through a large corpus of 4500 files. The goal was to identify the most effective method for searching the corpus quickly.

- Developed a simple linear search algorithm to search through the corpus of files.
- Implemented a hashtable using the Python dictionary data structure to improve search performance.
- Created custom hashtable implementations using different hashing algorithms to optimize search speed.
- Conducted benchmark tests to compare the performance of each search method and analyze the results.
